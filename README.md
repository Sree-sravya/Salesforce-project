This repository features a demo of a Salesforce CRM project developed as part of a hands-on learning internship experience. The project demonstrates how Salesforce can be used to create a low-code, customizable platform to manage customer interactions, inventory, and order processing efficiently.

About the Project
This project is designed to reflect a real-world business scenario, where products are tracked in inventory, customers place orders, and the system handles everything from stock deduction to sending automated notifications. It brings together the core capabilities of Salesforce, including:

Customer and Order Management:
Add and manage customer records
Place orders linked to specific customers and products
View and update order details including status, price, and quantity

Inventory Management:
Add and update product inventory
Automatically track stock levels
Block orders when an item is out of stock

Automation Using Flows:
Flows are used to automate tasks like:
Deducting stock when an order is placed
Sending alert emails for low inventory
Notifying customers as part of a loyalty program

Custom Logic with Apex
Apex triggers ensure that only valid orders are placed
Custom code updates inventory and order records in the background

This repository contains:
The full Salesforce source code including Apex classes, triggers, flows, and object definitions
A folder of screenshots to visually explain how the system works
