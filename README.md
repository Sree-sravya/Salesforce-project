This repository contains a Salesforce CRM project developed during a hands-on internship. The project demonstrates how Salesforce can be used to create a low-code, customizable solution for managing customer data, product inventory, and order processing.

The system allows users to create customer records, place and track orders, and manage inventory levels. It automates key processes using Salesforce flows, such as stock deduction, low stock email alerts, and customer notifications. Apex triggers are used to add custom logic, ensuring that orders are valid and inventory updates happen reliably.

The repository includes the full source code—Apex classes, triggers, flows, and object definitions—along with screenshots to explain the system visually. A video walkthrough is also available to see the project in action:
