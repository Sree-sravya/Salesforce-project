This repository features a demonstration of a Salesforce CRM project developed as part of a hands-on learning internship. The project shows how Salesforce can be used to build a low-code, customizable platform for managing customer interactions, product inventory, and order processing efficiently.

About the Project
This project is designed to reflect a practical business scenario, where products are tracked in inventory, customers place orders, and the system handles tasks such as stock deduction and automated notifications. It combines both Salesforceâ€™s declarative tools and programmatic features to deliver a complete CRM solution.

Customer and Order Management
Add and manage customer records

Place orders linked to specific customers and products

View and update order details including status, price, and quantity

Inventory Management
Add and update product inventory

Automatically track stock levels

Prevent orders when an item is out of stock

Automation Using Flows
Flows are used to automate routine processes:

Deduct stock when an order is placed

Send alert emails when inventory levels are low

Notify customers as part of a loyalty program

Custom Logic with Apex
Apex triggers ensure only valid orders are processed

Custom code handles inventory updates and order logic behind the scenes

Repository Contents
Salesforce source code including Apex classes, triggers, flows, and object definitions

A folder of screenshots that walk through the key features and functionality
