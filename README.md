This repository features a demo of a Salesforce CRM project developed as part of a hands-on learning internship experience. The project demonstrates how Salesforce can be used to create a low-code, customizable platform to manage customer interactions, inventory, and order processing efficiently.

Key Features
1. Custom Objects:
The project includes several custom objects such as Customer, Order, Inventory, and Item. These objects are interconnected using lookup and master-detail relationships to maintain data consistency.

2. Customer Management:
New customers can be created and tracked using custom fields. Their purchase history and interactions are maintained within the system for easy reference.

3. Order Placement:
Users can place new orders by selecting customers and items from the inventory. Each order captures essential details like quantity, price, date, and status. The system updates inventory levels automatically.

4. Inventory Management:
A custom object manages inventory items, tracking stock levels, item details, and availability. The system prevents orders from being placed if an item is out of stock.

5. Flow Automation:
Flows are used to automate repetitive tasks such as sending confirmation emails after order placement, updating inventory counts, and notifying users when stock is low. Record-triggered flows reduce manual effort and improve accuracy.

6. Apex Code:
Where declarative tools fall short, Apex triggers and classes are used to implement logic—such as validating order quantities, custom price calculations, and auto-assigning order statuses.

Purpose
This project simulates a scalable, real-world CRM application using Salesforce’s platform capabilities. It highlights the balance between no-code tools like flows and code-based extensions through Apex, making it easy to maintain while still powerful and flexible.
